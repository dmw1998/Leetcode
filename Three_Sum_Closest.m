% Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three
% integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return thee sum
% of the three integers. You may assume that each inout would have exactly
% one solution.

nums = [-1, 2, 1, 4];
target = 1;
output  = find_target_sum_triplet(nums,target)
