% You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape,
% where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
% Given n, find the total number of full staircase row that can be formed.
% n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-biit signed
% integer.

n = 5;
output = arrangeCoins(n)

n = 8;
output = arrangeCoins(n)
