% Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it
% while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
% Note:
% 1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
% 2. Minimize the total number of operations.

input = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12];
output = move_zero(input)
