% Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves
% required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a
% selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.
% You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

nums = [1, 2, 3];
output =  minMoves2(nums)

nums = [3, 8, 2, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6];
output =  minMoves2(nums)
