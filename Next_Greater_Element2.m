% Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first
% element of the array), print the Next Great Number for every element. The
% Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
% traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search
% circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output
% -1 for this number.

input = [1, 2, 1];
output = nextGreaterElements(input)
