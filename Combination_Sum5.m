% Given an integer array eith all positive numbers and no duplicates, find
% the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer
% target.
% Follow up:
% What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
% How does it change the problem?
% What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

nums = [1, 2, 3];
target = 4;
output = find_combination_sum5(nums, target)
