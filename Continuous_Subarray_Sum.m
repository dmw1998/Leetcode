% Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a
% function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least
% 2 that sums up to a multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where is also
% an integer.

nums = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7];
k = 6;
output = checkSubarraySum(nums, k)
