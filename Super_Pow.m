% Your task is to calculate a^b mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and
% b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

a = 2;
b = [3];
output = superPow(a,b)

a = 2;
b = [1,0];
output = superPow(a,b)

a = 1;
b = [4, 3, 3, 8, 5, 2];
output = superPow(a,b)

a = 2147483647;
b = [2, 0, 0];
output = superPow(a,b)
