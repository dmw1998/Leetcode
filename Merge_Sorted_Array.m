% Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1
% as one sorted array.
% Note:
% The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n
% respectively.
% You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n)
% to hold additional elements from nums2.

nums1 = [1, 2, 3];
nums2 = [2, 5, 6];
output = merge_arrays(nums1,nums2)
